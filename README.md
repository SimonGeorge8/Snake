## About the Project üéÆ
This project implements the classic Snake game using **Java** and **Swing** for the graphical interface. It showcases core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, as well as effective GUI development in Java. The game logic ensures a smooth and responsive experience, allowing players to control the snake as it grows and moves around the board.

## Key Features ‚ú®
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean and modular code leveraging Java's OOP capabilities.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using Swing for a simple and intuitive user interface.
- **Game Logic Management**: Implements game rules such as snake movement, growth, and collision detection.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Real-time control using keyboard inputs.
  
## How to Play üïπÔ∏è
- Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- The snake grows each time it eats the food.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body‚Äîif that happens, the game is over!
